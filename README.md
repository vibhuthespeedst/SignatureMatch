Project Name: Signature Matching System

Description
The Signature Matching System is an advanced solution designed to showcase the internal mechanisms of signature matching. This system features an intuitive and interactive interface for:

1. Uploading Signatures: Users can seamlessly upload signature images for verification.
2. Assigning Signatures: Uploaded signatures can be linked to specific user profiles for streamlined authentication.
3. Visualization: The system provides a detailed, step-by-step visualization of the signature matching process, offering insights into its inner workings.

Key Features
- Upload and Management: A dedicated tab for uploading and managing signature images.
- User Assignment: Assign uploaded signatures to user profiles for verification purposes.
- Process Explanation: A comprehensive, visual representation of the signature matching process.
- Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for a clean and responsive user experience.

Setup Instructions

1. Create a Virtual Environment
   Navigate to your project folder and execute the following command:
   ```
   python -m venv env_name
   ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
   - Windows:
     ```
     .\env_name\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source env_name/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install Dependencies
   Navigate to the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file and run:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Application
   Launch the application with Streamlit:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
   Replace `main.py` with the name of your Streamlit script.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- All required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.
